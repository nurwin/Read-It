<h4>If everyone is too lazy to read the fine print, let them to HEAR IT!</h4>
In the current era, there is no more people who want to read the fine print (ie TOS, EULA, legal documents). That's because the content of the fine print is too long, it makes people feel lazy to read it. In fact, the average length of the content of the fine print of the 10 major websites today is around ~4K words. 
We have a new concept to solve this problem. If everyone is too lazy to read the fine print, then let them **hear it**! 

So, the user can do other activities while r̶e̶a̶d̶  listen to the fine print, and users do not need to worry about the time wasted for Reading the Fine Print.
